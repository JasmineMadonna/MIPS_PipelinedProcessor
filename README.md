# MIPS_PipelinedProcessor
An implementation of MIPS 5-stage pipelined processor

This project is an implementation of a 5-stage pipelined processor for a subset of MIPS instruction set.
As of now, it will work for R-type instructions. Will be adding LW, SW and branch instructions too.

Also currently hazard detection and data bypassing is not implemented. It will be added too.
